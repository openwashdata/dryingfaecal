dewatering,"The dewaterability was assessed by measuring the extent of liquid that can be removed through centrifugation and by capillary suction time (CST) analysis. The results were correlated to the physiochemical characteristics of the faecal matter. The water activity of the solid residue after centrifugation was measured as well.
Faecal samples could be dewatered up to 60 – 70%wt depending on the source of the material. The liquid faecal samples with a moisture content higher than 85%wt presented a high dewaterability, whereas the samples with a thicker consistency (moisture content lower than 80%wt) exhibited moderate or poor dewaterability. The difference of dewaterability between the liquid and thick faecal materials could be due to the difference in unbound moisture content. Indeed, the liquid faecal samples could be dewatered to a further extent by their higher unbound moisture content. The water activity remained approximately equal to 1 before and after centrifugation. It can be then assumed that dewatering removed only unbound moisture under the explored conditions. The CST results could be correlated to the extra-polymer substances (EPS) concentration and electric conductivity (EC), but not for the volatile suspended solids (VSS). None correlation was found for the total solids content of the dewatered faecal material with the EPS concentration, EC and VSS content."
disinfection,"The disinfection aspect of drying was studied by tracking the viability of Ascaris eggs with time in faecal materials at different moisture contents and exposed to different temperatures. Ascaris eggs was selected as the pathogen desinfection indicator due to its high resilience. In fact, if the Ascaris eggs are deactivated under certain conditions, it can be supposed that other pathogens will also be destroyed.
According to the datasheets, the Ascaris deactivation rate increased exponentially with temperature. The eggs viability was not affected after exposure to 40oC for 2 hours, whereas complete inactivation was achieved at 80oC after a few seconds. The Ascaris eggs viability was also considerably reduced by exposing the eggs to faecal matter with a moisture content below 40%wt for a few weeks. For wetter faecal materials, the Ascaris eggs viability remained barely the same with time. These results denote that drying at high temperatures (> 60oC) and to low moisture contents (< 40%wt) enhances the disinfection of the waste."
gas_analysis,"The gas emission was examined by measuring the composition of the exhaust gas during faecal matter drying.
Apart from vapour water, other compounds were identified in the gas exhaust from the drying process, such as organic materials, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphure dioxide, ammonia and aerosols."
kinetics,"The kinetics were studied in the datasheets through the drying curves, which display the evolution of moisture content as a function of time at different operating conditions (air temperature or irradiance, air velocity, relative humidity, sample size, etc).
It can be concluded that faecal matter drying kinetics are the most sensitive to the heat input (temperature in the case of convective drying, or irradiance for solar and infrared drying). The air velocity, relative humidity and sample size had a low to moderate influence on the drying kinetics."
mechanical_properties,"The datasheets mechanical properties included the rheological, stickiness, and plastic properties at different moisture content and temperatures. The rheological properties were characterized by plotting the viscosity and shear stress as a function of the applied shear rate, as well as by the measurement of the loss and storage moduli, i.e. the viscous and elastic response of the material respectively, after short stimuli. The stickiness was studied through the determination of the cohesive and adhesive forces of the faecal materials. The plastic properties were investigated by measuring the plastic and liquid limits.
In summary, all faecal materials exhibited a shear thinning behaviour, meaning that the material viscosity decreased by shearing. At rest, the material exhibited a stronger elastic behaviour than viscous. Therefore, minimum shear stress needs to be applied to overcome the elastic deformation resistance for the material to start to flow. The decrease in the moisture content led to higher viscosities. Below a moisture content of 70 -60%wt, the faecal material lost its ability to flow. The faecal matters attained a peak of stickiness in the range of 60 to 40%wt moisture content, which could be seen by the highest values of the adhesive and cohesive forces. In general, the material cohesive forces were significantly higher than the adhesive ones, suggesting that the stickiness of the material within itself is higher than with surfaces. The faecal materials' liquid limit was located approximately at the moisture content level where the materials could no longer flow. The loss of the ability to flow of the faecal materials could be then correlated to the change of consistency from liquid to plastic. The plastic limit was found in the moisture content range from the sticky region, corroborating that faecal matter plastic and sticky behaviour are related to each other. Indeed, the sticky region marks the transition from a plastic sludge paste to a solid. The temperature modified the rheological and stickiness characteristics slightly by decreasing the viscosity, and increasing the adhesive and cohesive forces."
morphilogical_properties,"The morphology of the faecal material along the process was studied by measuring the shrinkage and through visual inspections. The specific surface and porosity were measured for the faecal matter dried at different temperatures.
The major phenomena detected during drying was: shrinkage up to 70% reduction in volume, cracking and crusting of the surface at the last stages of drying, and change of colour of the material. The drying temperature did not exhibit any significant influence on the specific surface and porosity of the faecal materials."
physiochemical_properties,"The evolution of the physiochemical properties of the various faecal materials during drying was determined by measuring the composition, calorific value, density and thermal properties at different stages of drying. The radiative properties of the raw samples were also measured in order to evaluate if the faecal materials are suitable for radiative processes (solar and infrared drying).The results demonstrated that the nutrient content, volatile solids content and calorific value in dry basis remained the same during drying at different conditions. However, the nitrogen chemical form changed during the process (decrease of ammonium, nitrates and nitrates), as well as the thermal properties and density. It was hypothesized that these changes were due to the loss of moisture combined with the increase of moisture boundedness along the process. Concerning the radiative properties, the faecal materials had a higher absorbance than reflectance, with an almost null transmissivity, in the visible light and near-infrared regions. This result implies that faecal matter is a suitable material for solar and infrared processes as most of the received radiation will be absorbed by the material for moisture removal."
thermodynamics,"The datasheets related to the thermodynamics aspects of drying included sorption isotherms, water activity, heat of drying and thermal stability data. The sorption isotherms provide the moisture content of the faecal sample at the thermodynamic equilibrium as a function of the air relative humidity at constant temperature. It also to determine the material hygroscopic properties. The water activity is a measure that gives an indication of the level of moisture boundedness within the material. The heat of drying quantifies the amount of energy required to dry the sample up to a given moisture content. The faecal matter thermal stability allows detecting the temperature range on which the sample dries and and the one on which it undergoes thermal degradation.
Overall, the equilibrium moisture content was low (> 30%wt) even at high relative humidities for the different faecal materials, suggesting that faecal matter can be dried to low moisture contents even in humid atmospheres (< 90%) at ambient temperature. The water activity tended to drop and the heat of drying to increase exponentially below a moisture content of around 30 - 40%, reflecting that moisture started to be tightly bound to the sludge from this point. The faecal materials shown to be hygroscopic as they can regain humidity after drying if they are placed in a humid atmosphere."
